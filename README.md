# eZ Platform Requirements and Specifications Repository

Welcome to our new Requirements and Specifications (specs, for short) repository for eZ Platform development! eZ's Product Management team will be moving our work here, storing specs in Markdown documents for easy access.

## Contributing
Do you have some ideas you'd like to contribute to a spec? It's easy! Simply fork this repository to your own GitHub account, and make any changes or additions you'd like to propose. Then, send a Pull Request back here where we can discuss things together.

If you'd like a good Markdown editor that can import, edit, and save MD files on GitHub, check out http://dillinger.io/

GitHub has a ridiculously easy-to-use integration with Jekyll to convert Markdown to HTML (heck, it goes even further and makes a website from Markdown files). Here's where we're playing with that functionality: [GitHub Pages Site for eZ Platform v2 Specs](https://ezsystems.github.io/specs/)
